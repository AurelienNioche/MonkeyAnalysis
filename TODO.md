# TO DO

### Figures 
* Display stats on figures [DONE]
* Freq against EV: put losses and gains on the same figure [DONE]

### Output table

* bias L/R [DONE]
* Each median control per type [DONE]
* Each best-fit parameter value [DONE]
* Total number of trials [DONE]
* documentation [DONE]
    
### Supplementary analysis
* for control: sigmoid EV / p choice [DONE]
* Reaction time / EV
    
### Data structure
* Choose between n_chunk and n_trial_per_chunk
 
### Define hypothesis

* Rank <=> risk
* understanding prob <=> rank
* Food access due to rank => risk

## Target
* Animal Cognition

# TO DO

Figures: 
* Display stats on figures [DONE]

* Freq against EV: put losses and gains on the same figure [DONE]

Data structure:
* Choose between n_chunk and n_trial_per_chunk

Output table: [DONE]

* bias L/R
* Each median control per type
* Each best-fit parameter value
    
Supplementary analysis:

* for control: sigmoid EV / p choice?
    
 
Define hypothesis:

* Rank <=> risk
* understanding prob <=> rank
* Food access due to rank => risk


Target:
* Animal Cognition
* Animal Behavior
